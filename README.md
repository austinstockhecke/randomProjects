# randomProjects
Welcome to this (small) repository!

This is just a compilation of small projects I've done to familiarize myself with a particular language. They're simply organized as single files in various folders pertaining to the language used. Most (if not all) of these projects will be simple and can be ran through any IDE, and are text based.
